**This is purely ideas and stuff just listed by the developer during coding**

1. For extra compatability (for example to blender or cura for 3d printing) we can convert the .step to .obj, as they dont accept .step.
2. We maybe do not charge users for now? - just let them use their own API keys for extra simplicity. 
3. Parametric history made by us, so after each agent edit, we save the file, so that the user can revert back to the "checkpoint"
4. We could utilise STEP1X-3D, where we input a picture, then get a 3d model. - maybe for quick prototyping? 
4.1 User inputs what they want, we genereate a picture via openAI or other provider, then Step1x-3d turns it into 3d, then we convert into .step.
5. We need to implement a way to generate colors and textures aswell, because python + cadquery doesnt really work for that.
